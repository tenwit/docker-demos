# Goal for today

Build prod-ready tomcat, using the Alpine-based one that we've been using for our integration tests.
We're an RHEL shop, and we've been allowed use CentOS because it's RedHat.
So we want to put sample.war on centos:7

Prerequisites:
* sample.war running on Alpine.
* goss (dgoss) installed (for the "T" part).
* VSCode installed (for the 1st "D").
* Prepared to write failing tests and refactor lots (for the 2nd "D").
